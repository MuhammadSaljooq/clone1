# VirtuPro Marketing Site Clone (Static + TypeScript)

This is a static, non-commercial clone inspired by the layout and content structure visible on `https://virtupro.io/` for development and learning purposes only. All trademarks, logos, and brand names are the property of their respective owners.

## Getting Started

1. Open `virtupro-clone/index.html` directly in your browser.
2. The page uses `main.js` for interactions to avoid a build step; the original `main.ts` is included for reference.

## Structure

- `index.html` — page markup (sections: hero, integrations, features, reviews, FAQs, CTAs, footer)
- `styles.css` — responsive styles
- `main.ts` — TypeScript source for interactions (hamburger menu, smooth scroll)
- `main.js` — JavaScript output used by the browser

## Notes

- This project mirrors content structure from `https://virtupro.io/` and is not affiliated with VirtuPro. Use as a reference only.
